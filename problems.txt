<stdio.h> and <iostream> headers, while implementing
required algorithms yourself.
o Practice solving problems with brute force as optimization is usually not required in this level of
the exam, and given memory is plenty (usually 256MB to 1GB). o Some important topics to practice are:
a. Recursion (Brute Force):
i. Permutation: O(n!) solution to problems. ii. Combination: O(nCr) solution to problems. iii. Subset: O(2n) solution to problems.
iv. Simulation: Variable time complexity.
1. Board game simulation
2. Job scheduling simulation
3. Rotating/Reflecting/Copying 2D Array simulation
b. Graphs:
i. Graphs represented with 2D Array
ii. DFS
iii. BFS: Queue implementation might be required.
c. Basic algorithms:
i. O(n2) array sorting.
ii. Queue/Stack data structures.
iii. Successive sums
iv. Any algorithms you can find which are not hard to implement or do not require any concep
