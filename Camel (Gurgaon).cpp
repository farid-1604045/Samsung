Note - the code can be further optimized but for n = 8 it wil work fine 

A man has some camels with him.He has to take these camels to the opposite end.Each camel has some cost to go from one end to other.
->While going to opposite end , he will take 2 camels along with him, the cost will be the maximum of the cost of both the camels.
->On reaching opposite end, he will take one camel from opposite end to go back to first end, the cost will be taken as the cost of that camel.
->At the end, he has to move all the camels to the opposite end.
Find the minimum cost to take camels to opposite end.
Example->
INPUT
2              //No of test cases
4              //No of camels in first test case
1 2 8 9        //Cost of camels
6
14 45 73 86 95 98
OUTPUT
16
434

SOLUTION->
1) First he will take camel 1 and camel 2 to opposite end , so the cost will be -max(1,2)=2
2) Next he will come from camel 1 , cost will be- 1.
3) Now he will take camel 3 and camel 4 to opposite end , cost will be - max(8,9)=9
4) Now he will come back using camel 2 which was already at opposite end ,cost- 2
5) Now only camel 1 and camel 2 are left, he will take them both.cost=max(1,2)=2

Total cost = 2+1+9+2+2=16
